run no 1 finished 4/17/18 used GQGt(3,3) = (0.9*STDFex)^2 first time that all the runs worked direct ID
run no 2 uses a static GQGt(3,3) = 2000; to see if this provides better results for identification 
-> It does not make things better, the only run that is better is run 2 and it goes from 0.50 to 0.51. 
	all of the other terms either stay the same or get worses going from run 1 to 2.
run no 3 finished 4/19/18 used GQGt(3,3) = (0.9*STDFex)^2 now the NMSE of the water particle estimation is included
run no 4 same as 3 except (0.95*STDFex)^2 is used. this is better by a very small amount.
run no 5 is a run of all 17 wave climates for 30 seconds using the disturbance estimation with 0.95*stdFex^2 3 disturbance frequencies
run no 6 is a run of all 17 using the disturbance estimation method with 2 frequencies. o.95*Fex
run no 7 "" with 1 frequencies using the disturbance method. note the process noise needed to be lowered (0.8*...) and this took a LONG time
run no 8 "" back to 0.95*Fex uses 4 frequencies for disturbance estimation
run no 9 "" 5 frequencies
run no 10 3rd order disturbance method Process noise lowered to 0.75 with subsampleNo = 1. (for reference)
